const DATA = [{"title": "Dragon Pearl ‚Äî Academic Rewrite", "text": "Min, the adolescent narrator of the original passage, belongs to a family of gumiho, or fox spirits, living on the terraformed planet Jinju. The voice is calm and observant rather than sensational. Min begins not with cosmic battle but with domestic routine: before the sun is fully up, the house is alive with chores. Hydroponic trays must be scrubbed, air-filters checked so that dust does not invade lungs or machinery, and breakfast coaxed from vegetables grown without soil. The detail signals the fragility of life on a marginal world where survival depends upon technology and collective discipline. Sleep is a luxury; work is a social glue.\n\nWithin that routine, Min nurtures a private countdown toward her sixteenth birthday. At that age she will be eligible to sit for the competitive examination that could admit her to the Thousand Worlds‚Äô Space Forces, where her admired older brother, Jun, already serves. The dream is not simply adventure. It is a drive toward competence and recognition in a culture that often denies people like her the chance to participate fully. Adolescence appears here as the tension between household obligation and the hope of public contribution.\n\nThe narrative then zooms into the close quarters of home. Min shares a room with cousins; blankets are hand-me-downs from the earliest colonists and are thick with embroidery‚Äîdragons, flowers, and encoded wishes for good fortune. Such objects function as portable archives. They do not merely decorate; they preserve the settlers‚Äô stories and moral world, binding the contemporary household to an origin myth of hardship and perseverance. Yet the same space contains the ordinary frictions of kinship. Cousin Bora teases and jostles; there is affection, but also impatience, noise, and the small injustices of crowded living. These details keep the scene honest.\n\nRunning below this domestic realism is a more complex social negotiation. Min‚Äôs family are fox spirits who present themselves as human. They can shape-shift and they possess an ability called Charm‚Äîsubtle magic that influences perception. Min‚Äôs mother enforces strict rules of discretion: the children must act as ‚Äúproper, civilized gumiho,‚Äù avoiding tricks that might frighten neighbors or confirm malicious folktales. The family ethic is not self-hatred; it is strategic restraint in a polity that has rarely judged them fairly. In this moral economy, power must be disciplined by reflection.\n\nThe prejudice they endure is cultural rather than empirical. Popular tales accuse foxes of luring travelers and stealing vitality. Though demonstrably false for Min‚Äôs family, these narratives circulate with the force of common sense. The irony is sharp: other magical communities inhabit the Thousand Worlds quite openly. Dragons deploy weather magic for agriculture and climate engineering. Goblins use their invisibility caps for courier work and political intelligence. Shamans serve as vital intermediaries between citizens and the spirit world. Foxes alone carry the stain of treachery in the public imagination. Min notes that many people find it convenient to assume foxes are extinct. Extinction operates as a comforting fiction that absolves the majority from revising their prejudices.\n\nThus the home becomes a training ground where inherited power is subjected to ethical deliberation. The family refuses practices that echo the folklore of predation, and they teach the children to measure magic against consequences for trust. The result is a delicate civics: how does one participate in a society that denies one‚Äôs presence? For Min, the answer is not to disappear but to excel‚Äîquietly at first, and then, she hopes, publicly. Joining the Space Forces would allow her to prove competence in a domain that values skill over rumor. It would also place a fox spirit visibly within an institution that shapes planetary life, signaling a different future for others like her.\n\nStylistically, the world of the piece is a thoughtful juxtaposition. The vocabulary of engineering‚Äîhydroponics, air-filters, terraforming‚Äîsits alongside cultural terms such as gumiho and Charm. The contrast insists that myth and technology are not rivals but intertwined systems through which communities imagine order and risk. The narrative avoids melodrama; it prefers careful noticing, small conflicts, and clear moral stakes. In the end, Min‚Äôs irritation at lingering stigma is tempered by resolve. She will prepare, take the exam, and attempt to widen the horizon of belonging. The passage, read academically, therefore becomes less a fantasy vignette than a case study in minority ethics under conditions of technological modernity: how a household sustains dignity, how a young person negotiates identity, and how public institutions either restrict or expand the forms of life that can be imagined.", "questions": [{"q": "What best describes the setting of Min‚Äôs daily life?", "options": ["A fertile agricultural planet with abundant water", "A terraformed colony where survival depends on technology and routine", "A medieval village hidden from the wider galaxy", "A luxury space station populated by officers"], "answer": 1, "explanation": "Hydroponics, air filters, and dust seals show a fragile terraformed settlement."}, {"q": "Min‚Äôs aspiration to join the Space Forces primarily represents what tension?", "options": ["Individual freedom versus loyalty to her brother", "Desire for wealth versus moral restraint", "Adolescent ambition versus household obligation", "Obedience to law versus hunger for adventure"], "answer": 2, "explanation": "She wants to follow Jun and see the galaxy but has chores and duties."}, {"q": "Why does Min‚Äôs family conceal their fox magic?", "options": ["They are ashamed of their ancestry.", "Displaying magic would violate Space Forces law.", "History shows that visibility invites prejudice and danger.", "Their powers are too weak to be seen."], "answer": 2, "explanation": "Discretion protects them from suspicion."}, {"q": "The embroidered blankets and hangings serve mainly to show:", "options": ["The wealth of Min‚Äôs family", "How technology replaces culture", "Continuity of ancestral memory among settlers", "Government propaganda"], "answer": 2, "explanation": "Textiles preserve myths and symbols."}, {"q": "Which group is portrayed as celebrated for openly using magic?", "options": ["Fox spirits", "Dragons", "Ordinary human settlers", "Space pirates"], "answer": 1, "explanation": "Dragons use weather magic for agriculture and climate engineering."}, {"q": "Min‚Äôs mother‚Äôs rule that the children behave as 'proper, civilized gumiho' implies:", "options": ["Strict etiquette aimed at preventing trouble with neighbors", "A rejection of all magical traditions", "A command to prank humans respectfully", "A plan to emigrate soon"], "answer": 0, "explanation": "It‚Äôs about discretion and good conduct."}, {"q": "The term 'Charm' in the passage refers to:", "options": ["Attractiveness of Jinju‚Äôs landscape", "A fox ability to influence perception", "A ceremonial necklace worn by settlers", "A rank within the Space Forces"], "answer": 1, "explanation": "Charm is a facet of fox magic."}, {"q": "Min‚Äôs critique of Jinju‚Äôs society focuses on:", "options": ["Environmental collapse and famine", "Lack of schools for teenagers", "Persistent stereotypes about foxes despite acceptance of other magical beings", "Too much celebration of folklore"], "answer": 2, "explanation": "Others are valued;

Tamarind, a British-Indian girl traveling with her father, steps off a long-haul flight into the heat of an Indian city. The first experience is sensory: thick air presses against skin, clothing clings, and the smell of jet fuel blends with spices from food courts. The lights of the concourse are too bright after the plane‚Äôs dim cabin, and conversations churn in unfamiliar languages that are musical yet opaque. The airport is an institution designed to move bodies efficiently, but for Tamarind it is also a classroom where breath, sound, and temperature begin to teach her what it means to be located in a new place.\n\nThe walk to immigration is slow. She grips her passport and landing card; responsibility that usually signals independence here magnifies vulnerability. Passengers around her are vivid: women in saris stitched with gold at the hems, men with neat moustaches and rings, children weaving through the queue. Clothing functions as social text‚Äîsimultaneously ordinary and ceremonial‚Äîreminding her that she is entering a network of meanings that she partly shares by heritage and partly must learn anew. Though she is with her father, whose ease in this environment is reassuring, Tamarind is keenly aware of her own accent, her British habits, and the fear that her words might fail.\n\nFormalities proceed: stamps fall; bags clatter onto scanners; the sliding doors open onto the arrivals hall. Relatives surge forward with garlands and laughter. They speak rapidly, asking about the flight, urging that she eat, taking her suitcase before she can protest. The choreography of hospitality is generous to the point of disorientation. Kinship terms‚Äî‚Äúauntie,‚Äù ‚Äúuncle,‚Äù ‚Äúdidi,‚Äù ‚Äúbhai‚Äù‚Äîcondense affection and status; they map a social world in which relatedness is not left to biology alone but enacted through respect. Tamarind struggles to match names to faces, yet the sheer warmth of the welcome pushes back against the chill of strangeness.\n\nThe car ride out of the airport opens another field of attention. Through the window Tamarind observes roadside shrines, fruit sellers, scooters nosing between buses, and apartment blocks painted in pastels dimmed by dust. Billboards announce film releases and tutoring centers. The city‚Äôs movement seems governed by an internal rhythm that is neither random nor familiar. She compares it to her neighborhood in Britain where the air is cool and the horizon narrow with rain. The comparison is descriptive rather than judgmental; it marks how climate and color tune emotion. In this heat, time thickens; distances feel longer; speech slows.\n\nArrival at the family home converts public hospitality into domestic intimacy. A bed has been made in a room cleared for her; a plate of sweets waits on the desk; shoes line the doorway for easy removal. Her hosts have already drawn up a schedule‚Äîtemple in the morning, lunch at a relative‚Äôs, market in the evening. Tamarind feels gratitude but also a kind of ethical pressure. She wants to honor the labor of welcome. That means learning forms of address, receiving food with the right hand, understanding when to help and when to allow herself to be served. Etiquette, in this account, is not empty performance but a medium for translating care across households and languages.\n\nThe narrative‚Äôs most reassuring moment occurs in miniature. A cousin around her age reaches for a high-five, speaks fluent English, and declares that they will be friends. The gesture is slightly embarrassing yet decisive: it recognizes Tamarind not as an abstract emissary of diaspora but as a person with whom one can joke and walk and get lost. The anxiety about accent and the fear of ‚Äúsaying it wrong‚Äù do not vanish, but they are reframed by relationship. Belonging, the passage suggests, is a process carried forward by small acts of friendliness practiced within larger structures of kinship.\n\nStylistically the writing privileges careful noticing. Textiles, jewelry, and street scenes anchor the reader in material culture. Breath, sweat, and the weight of luggage grant the city the density of embodied life. Thematically, the scene resists a simple narrative of ‚Äúreturn to roots.‚Äù Tamarind does not discover a ready-made identity waiting at the gate. Instead, she enters a conversation‚Äîliteral and figurative‚Äîwith people who claim her and whom she must also learn to claim. Airport, car, and household together compose a rite of passage that is not solemn but continuous: each new interaction requires attentiveness, humility, and humor. In this sense, the excerpt is less a travel anecdote than a study in the ethics of arrival.", "questions": [{"q": "Where does the scene primarily take place?", "options": ["On a train crossing India",

Rewrite", "text": "Daniel Tammet‚Äôs memoir offers an unusually precise account of neurodivergent perception. The excerpt centers on how numbers appear to him not as neutral symbols but as entities with color, texture, and emotional temperature. Days and dates acquire atmospheres; Wednesday may feel ‚Äúblue,‚Äù a prime number might gleam like polished stone, and a composite number might seem lumpy or awkward. This is a form of synaesthesia‚Äîan interweaving of the senses that, in his case, fuses arithmetic with imagery and feeling. The effect is not a random hallucination; it is a stable internal landscape that he consults when thinking.\n\nBecause sensory experience for him is intense, routine becomes a tool of regulation. Daniel measures exactly forty-five grams of breakfast cereal; he counts clothing items before leaving the house; he keeps objects aligned. These practices are not mere quirks or superstitions. They are scaffolding: structures that steady attention and reduce the anxiety that sudden change can provoke. When the scaffolding holds, he can attend to tasks with clarity and calm. Disruption‚Äîcups out of place, a timetable suddenly shifted‚Äîfeels not only inconvenient but physiologically stressful. Routine, then, is an enabling technology of the self.\n\nThe memoir situates these habits within the framework of savant syndrome, in which islands of exceptional ability coexist with other developmental differences. Daniel‚Äôs islands are numerical and linguistic. He visualizes wide landscapes of primes and can navigate them directly; he learns languages rapidly; he remembers long digit sequences because they form distinctive shapes and textures in his mental field. Crucially, he resists explanations that romanticize talent as miraculous. The capacities emerge from a coherent mental architecture‚Äîunusual, yes, but intelligible when one understands how his perceptions are organized.\n\nPopular culture often reaches for the film Rain Man to interpret such abilities. Daniel acknowledges the comparison while gently pushing back. Spectacle eclipses personhood; cinema compresses experience into a narrow frame. By contrast, his daily life includes the mundane and the relational: conversation that must be learned rather than intuited, friendships that grow through patience, and work that benefits from carefully chosen environments. He describes strategies‚Äîrehearsed phrases, predictable routines, the selection of quieter spaces‚Äîthat make social interaction sustainable. Over time he becomes an advocate for himself and for others whose minds operate off the statistical norm.\n\nThe imagery he uses to describe numbers is especially instructive. Some numbers are ‚Äúbright,‚Äù others ‚Äúquiet.‚Äù Five might feel like a clap of thunder; eighty-nine like falling snow. These are not eccentric similes deployed for literary effect, he insists, but the most accurate translations he can devise for stable sensations. The language of weather and landscape helps the reader imagine why certain problems are easy for him: numbers do not have to be computed step by step if they can be recognized as shapes that announce themselves at once. Primes, for instance, seem clean and pebble-like‚Äîdiscrete forms that stand apart from the divisible clutter around them.\n\nPlace itself can resonate with number. Standing in New York‚Äôs Times Square, dwarfed by towers and light, he thinks of nine, the number he associates with immensity. The city does not drown his perception but meets it. External and internal architectures align, producing a moment of apprehension that is both mathematical and aesthetic. Such vignettes suggest that neurodivergent perception is not a barrier to appreciating the world; it is a distinct mode of appreciation that can make cities and ideas newly legible.\n\nAcross the passage the tone stays explanatory and generous. Daniel does not ask for awe; he asks for understanding. He writes with specificity about breakfast, clothing counts, and interviews, grounding abstract claims about mind in the ordinary textures of life. Neither does he deny difficulty. Social cues that most people process automatically can be opaque or exhausting. Yet difficulty is not destiny. With strategies and with institutions willing to adapt‚Äîworkplaces that tolerate routine, schools that respect atypical learning‚Äîdifference becomes a site of creativity and joy. The memoir thus invites the reader to reframe intelligence, not as a single scale on which people rise or fall, but as an ecology of abilities that can be cultivated with the right supports.",
